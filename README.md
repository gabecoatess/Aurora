# Project Aurora
## About
### Who?
This program is targeted for mostly everyone of all ages that attend some sort of education or want to better manage their learning. Students will be able to access vital information with a few clicks, from their GPA to eventually ways to apply for colleges or scholarships. Teachers will be able to use Aurora as a unified grading experience and student attendance. Parents will also be able to use Aurora as a hub for their child or children, giving them information through notifications from the teacher or automatically through the Aurora app. If you dont go to any sort of educational system and just want to manage your learning (i.e. learning how to code or paint) Aurora has just the right tools for you!

### What?
Project Aurora is a prototype data unification application for students, teachers, and parents. It combines all the necessary numbers into one single application.

### When?
Starting on February 1st, 2021, I will be writing at least 1 line of code everyday until the product is usable and useful. I will try to continue to add new features and fix bugs as time will allow me. However, an expected finish date is still being determined.

### Why?
I created this project because I personally found it difficult to keep track of my grades across multiple websites and to figure out whats the latest grade. I also found it quite annoying that the GPA calculators online are over-complicated and calculating my own GPA was easy but took way to long. I wanted a unified experience, so parents, teachers, and students know what grade they have in classes, their assignment due dates, notes, GPA, and a ton more.

### How?
This question is still being answered. But the way that I figured I will go about this is by creating different versions of the application. First one running on a Windows 10 Desktop. After that, I would like to be able to port it to Linux, Mac, Android, and iOS. For anyone who cannot download the application, they can use the web-based version, though limited.

## Setup
